Description
-----------

This is a web application for posting topics and replies. It serves more as 
a prototype for a messaging application that needs more consideration. 
Topics and replies are updated on the page dynamically at specified 
intervals (non-streaming). Any deleted replies are marked in red during 
the update process so the user does not have to waste their time replying 
to a deleted post. Topics and replies are generated in XML then transformed 
with XSLT. It's written in PHP and Javascript (with JQuery).  

See the screenshots or the wiki page.

The .htaccess file is located the core directory.
