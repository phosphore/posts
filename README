Description
-----------

This is a web application for posting topics and replies. It serves more as a prototype 
for a messaging application that needs more consideration.  Topics and replies are 
updated on the page dynamically at specified intervals.  Deleted replies are marked in 
red during the update process so the user does not have to waste their time replying 
to a deleted post. It's written in PHP, Javascript (with JQuery) and PostgreSQL. 

See screenshots.

Don't forget the .htaccess file in the core directory
