h1. Dynamic message board web application

h2. Description

Adaptation for WAMPs servers.

Topics and replies are updated on the page dynamically at specified intervals (non-streaming). 
Any deleted replies are marked in red during the update process so the user does not have to 
waste their time replying to a deleted post. Topics and replies are generated in XML then 
transformed with XSLT. It's written in PHP and Javascript (with JQuery).
